- **Transparent installation**: Every command is shown before it's run.
- **Automatic setup**: with the `--auto` flag everything will be automatically installed and setup with proper symlinks using stow.

    <h2>• usage •</h2>
    <h3></h3>
</div>

Run `bootstrap.sh` with `--auto` to automatically install packages and link configs.
Or use `--skip-update` with `--auto` to automatically install packages and link configs without updating the package repo(s) and your entire system.

<h4>Please insure bash is installed and available.</h4>

Alternately, In a POSIX-Compilant Shell:

```
source bootstrap.sh
```

`Bash` is recommended by the developer as it is what he used, but `sh` can also be used.
Nothing else is recommended and may not behave correctly, Z Shell(zsh) has been tested and gave errors.

**Optional:** Customize the pkgs/*.txt files to include the packages you want.

    <h2>• notes •</h2>
    <h3></h3>
</div>

- The scripts should be sourced in the following order for proper setup:

  - update_system.sh ( **WARNING** the setup may not function properly without it)

  - install_pkgs.sh

  - stow_configs.sh

  - setup_shell.sh

  - install_flatpak.sh

- For multi-user setups (like Nix), packages may need to be installed per-user.

- Scripts are to be run one at a time through bootstrap.sh. If the user wishes he may run them manually **but** it is not recommanded as it will break some things.

- **The user is expected to backup important files beforehand**.

- The files present inside `home/shellconf/` should be edited according to the user's liking, containing `alias`, `functions` and other things to the users liking as they as automatically sourced at every new instance.

- The hyprland dots are incomplete and not fully functunal, if you wish to use the same setup as me, use this <a href="https://https://ii.clsty.link/en/">setup</a> by <a href="https://github.com/end-4">end-4</a>

- The scripts are currently focused on Arch, as it is what the creator (me) used to create them.

<h2>• inspirations/copying •</h2>

- This project was heavily inspired by <a href="https://github.com/end-4">end-4</a>’s legendary dotfile structure and their approach to transparent, idempotent setup scripts.

- Copying: Personally I have absolutely no problem with others redistributing/recreating my work. There's no "stealing" (maybe unless you loudly do weird stuff).

**P.S. The scripts were written on Arch Linux and haven’t yet been tested on other distros.**
